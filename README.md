## Global Variables

- `drawdownLimit` (default: 0.2): Specifies the maximum allowed drawdown.
- `totalOrders`: Keeps track of the total number of open orders.

## Expert Advisor Initialization

The `OnInit` function is called when the Expert Advisor is initialized. It sets up necessary trading functions and returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` to indicate successful initialization.

## Expert Advisor Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit` function is called before the Expert Advisor is deinitialized. It closes all open orders before deinitialization.

## Expert Advisor Start

The `OnTick` function is called on each tick. It performs the following tasks:
